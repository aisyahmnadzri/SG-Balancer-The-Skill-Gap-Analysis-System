## 📊 Skill Gap Analysis System (SG-Balancer)

**Project Category** - *Generative AI*

**STATUS:** 🟡 **ONGOING** — *Project Timeline: December 2025 - March 2026*

---

### 🚀 Overview

SG-Balancer is an AI-powered **Skill Gap Analysis System** that helps users understand how well their current skills match a desired job role.

Users can:

* Paste a **job description**
* Match it against their **existing skills**
* Identify **missing skills**
* Receive **learning recommendations** generated by an LLM

The system combines **LLM reasoning**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and a **FastAPI backend**.

---

### 🧠 How It Works

1. **Job Description Input**

   * User pastes a job description for their target role.

2. **Skill Extraction**

   * LLM extracts required skills from the job description.

3. **User Skill Retrieval (RAG)**

   * Existing user skills are retrieved using:

     * Dense semantic search (embeddings)
     * Sparse keyword matching (hybrid retrieval)

4. **Skill Gap Analysis**

   * System compares required skills vs existing skills.

5. **Recommendations**

   * Missing skills are identified.
   * Learning recommendations are generated using:

     * A curated skill recommendation library
     * LLM-based reasoning for unseen skills

### 🏗️ Tech Stack

**Backend**

* FastAPI
* Python 3.11.9

**LLM & NLP**

* Hugging Face Transformers
* FLAN-T5 (CPU)

**Retrieval (RAG)**

* ChromaDB (Vector Database)
* Sentence Transformers (Embeddings)
* Hybrid Dense + Sparse Retrieval

**Deployment (Planned)**

* Docker
* Cloud deployment (TBD)
